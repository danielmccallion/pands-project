# pands-project

A project for the Programming and Scripting module using Fisher's Iris data set.

The Dataset <br />

This project is on the well-known Fishers Iris dataset. It is a dataset used by Ronald Fisher in his paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' in 1936.
The data was collected by Edgar Anderson.

It contains measurements on the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width of three species of Iris flower. The three types of flowers in the dataset are Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica. 50 samples of each flower were taken 


The Project <br />

For the project python had to be used to analyse the dataset and create sets of graphs from it using python libaries. The dataset was downloaded in csv form and is saved here for use in the project. The program reads the file and creates a summary of all data and its variables to a text file. In the text file many things can be seen such as total records in the dataset, the average values of differnet variables aswell as min and max values for example.

The script outputs a seperate histogram for petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. In the histogram each class of Iris flower has a differnet colour and is semi transparent to tell apart each flower type. Matplotlib was used for this.

For the project it was also required to output a scatterplot of each pair of variable. The Seaborn was used for this and each Iris class was given a differnent colour and symbol.

Also added was a pair plot to easily view all the differences in each variable all at once. Seaborn was used again here and this was easy and quick to add showing how easy python can help with data analysis. 


Analysis <br />

Petal width was the biggest difference in each class of flower and can be used to tell them apart.


How to Run <br />

This project is written in python and must be run in a python enviroment with the seaborn, matplotlib and pandas libraries.
